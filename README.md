# Solidity Template

My favorite setup for writing Solidity smart contracts.

- [Hardhat](https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat): compile and run the smart contracts on a local development network
- [TypeChain](https://github.com/ethereum-ts/TypeChain): generate TypeScript types for smart contracts
- [Ethers](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/): renowned Ethereum library and wallet implementation
- [Waffle](https://github.com/EthWorks/Waffle): tooling for writing comprehensive smart contract tests
- [Solhint](https://github.com/protofire/solhint): linter
- [Solcover](https://github.com/sc-forks/solidity-coverage): code coverage
- [Prettier Plugin Solidity](https://github.com/prettier-solidity/prettier-plugin-solidity): code formatter

This is a GitHub template, which means you can reuse it as many times as you want. You can do that by clicking the "Use this
template" button at the top of the page.

## To understand better the hardhat dev framework:

Hardhat -> sets up development environment for all stages: (compiling, testing, deployment)
GENERAL PURPOSE:
Ethers -> library that allows for contracts interactions and the definition of wallets abstractions
It is used in all dev stages: inside the typescript types, during testing and also for deployment
COMPILING:
SOLC -> solidity compiler
TypeChain -> Generates typescript types for the smart contracts (pluggin) whenever we compile
TESTING:
Waffle-> testing framework for smart contracts
Chai -> assertion library
Mocha -> BDD/asynchronous testing/js testing framework
DEPLOYMENT:
Tasks -> They are scripts with a pre-defined structure that are to be run using hardhat CLI

## Usage

### Pre Requisites

Before running any command, you need to create a `.env` file and set a BIP-39 compatible mnemonic as an environment
variable. Follow the example in `.env.example`. If you don't already have a mnemonic, use this [website](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/) to generate one.

Then, make sure you have yarn installes, if not, you can install it with npm:

npm install --global yarn

Then, proceed with installing dependencies:

```sh
yarn install
```

### Compile

Compile the smart contracts with Hardhat:

```sh
$ yarn compile
```

### TypeChain

Compile the smart contracts and generate TypeChain artifacts:

```sh
$ yarn typechain
```

### Lint Solidity

Lint the Solidity code:

```sh
$ yarn lint:sol
```

### Lint TypeScript

Lint the TypeScript code:

```sh
$ yarn lint:ts
```

### Test

Run the Mocha tests:

```sh
$ yarn test
```

### Coverage

Generate the code coverage report:

```sh
$ yarn coverage
```

### Report Gas

See the gas usage per unit test and average gas per method call:

```sh
$ REPORT_GAS=true yarn test
```

### Clean

Delete the smart contract artifacts, the coverage reports and the Hardhat cache:

```sh
$ yarn clean
```

### Deploy

Deploy the contracts to Hardhat Network:

```sh
$ yarn deploy --greeting "Bonjour, le monde!"
```

## Syntax Highlighting

If you use VSCode, you can enjoy syntax highlighting for your Solidity code via the [hardhat-vscode](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat-vscode) extension.
